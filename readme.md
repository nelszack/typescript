## Overview

**Project Title**: sortlists.ts

**Project Description**: sorts lists using a bubble sort heap sort or merge sort

**Project Goals**: to learn how typesript works and to learn some soring alorithums

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. complile the typescript file to javascript using tsc [typescript file]
2. run the javascript file using node [javascript file]

Instructions for using the software:

1. use it to sort a lists
2. use it to test different sorting algorithums

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* node.js
* typescript
* an IDE to run code in  

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Typescript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
* [W3shools DSA](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/)
*

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Improve the algorithums 
* [ ] add more soting algorithums
* [ ]
